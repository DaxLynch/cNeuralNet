# MNIST Classifier in C

## Introduction

This project is a simple digit classifier for the MNIST dataset implemented in C. The primary goal is to revisit and reinforce the understanding of the backpropagation algorithm by implementing a neural network from scratch. In doing so I had to make a c matrix library, which I used as an opportunity to make optimized multithreaded matrix algorithms, utilizing either openMP, pthreads, or CUDA.

### Key Objectives

- Relearn and implement the backpropagation algorithm for neural network training.
- Develop a modular and efficient C matrix library to support matrix operations.
- Lay the groundwork for potential future enhancements, such as multithreaded matrix algorithms.

I followed this textbook, http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com,
which had very good information regarding the algorithms for the implementation. 

## Results

In the above output, I run the program. It
